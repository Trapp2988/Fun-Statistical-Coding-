    "Goal: After 20 rounds, whoever has the most points wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "How a round works\n",
    "\n",
    "• Players take turns rolling two dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "• You can choose to bank on your turn. Banking means you lock in your current points for that round and stop rolling.\n",
    "\n",
    "• A round ends in one of two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Someone rolls a 7 after the third roll of the round, or\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Every player chooses to bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Special rules\n",
    "\n",
    "• Rolling a 7 in the first three rolls: instead of ending the round, it adds 70 points to the bank (the shared pot for the round).\n",
    "\n",
    "• Rolling a 7 after the third roll: this ends the round and whoever banked their points keeps them; anyone who didn’t bank loses what they hadn’t locked in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "• Doubles (like 3–3, 5–5, etc.):\n",
    "\n",
    " – If this happens after the third roll, the entire bank doubles.\n",
    "\n",
    " – If it happens within the first three rolls, it just counts as the normal total (like 6 for double 3s).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "• The bank is the shared pot players are trying to grab points from by banking before the round ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "• When you bank, you take the current bank amount as your points for that round and you’re done rolling.\n",
    "\n",
    "• After 20 rounds, the highest total score wins."
